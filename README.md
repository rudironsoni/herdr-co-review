# co-review

**Interactive, split-screen PR co-review between you and your AI agent, inside
[Herdr](https://herdr.dev).**

Reviewing a PR with an agent usually means reading a wall of findings in the
agent's pane, with none of the surrounding code, and then either trusting them or
tediously cross-checking each one on GitHub. `co-review` turns that into a
side-by-side collaboration:

- One command checks the PR out into an isolated worktree and starts your agent
  (Claude by default) on it, with a configurable prompt.
- Herdr lays out a **split-screen**: the agent reviews on the left; a **navigator
  TUI** runs on the right.
- In the navigator you select a finding and immediately see **its related code**
  — the PR's own diff hunk around the referenced lines, syntax-highlighted, with
  the exact lines marked.
- You triage each finding (approve / dismiss / discuss / edit / note) and can
  **message the agent about the selected finding** straight into its pane.
- The agent keeps driving everything that doesn't need you — most importantly,
  **posting the approved findings to GitHub** when you're done.

It's the two of you reviewing together, instead of the agent throwing findings
over the wall.

## How it works

`co-review` is a single Rust binary with a few subcommands. `start` is the
orchestrator; the agent and the navigator share one lock-guarded state file and
talk to each other through the `co-review` CLI:

```
        co-review start 123
                │
   ┌────────────┴─────────────┐
   │ git worktree of the PR   │
   │ + shared session state   │
   └────────────┬─────────────┘
                │  herdr workspace create / pane split
   ┌────────────┴───────────────────────────────┐
   │ Herdr workspace (both panes get             │
   │ CO_REVIEW_SESSION + CO_REVIEW_BIN)          │
   │ ┌───────────────┐   ┌────────────────────┐  │
   │ │ agent (left)  │   │ navigator (right)  │  │
   │ │ reviews, runs │◀─▶│ co-review view     │  │
   │ │ "$CO_REVIEW_  │   │ select finding →   │  │
   │ │ BIN" add-...  │   │ see code, triage,  │  │
   │ │ hands off     │   │ chat, decide       │  │
   │ └───────────────┘   └────────────────────┘  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The contract between the two halves is a small set of CLI verbs (see
[`co-review protocol`](#the-agent-contract)), which is what makes it
**agent-agnostic**: anything that can run shell commands can drive it.

## Install

`git` is required at runtime; Herdr is needed for the split-screen (everything
else works without it). You do **not** need Rust unless you build from source.

### Prebuilt binary (recommended)

Every release ships binaries for Linux and macOS (x86_64 and aarch64) and Windows
(x86_64) at [Releases](https://github.com/elKei24/herdr-co-review/releases). The
installer picks the right one for your machine:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elKei24/herdr-co-review/main/install.sh | sh
```

It installs to the first of `/usr/local/bin` and `~/.local/bin` that is writable
and on your PATH, falling back to `~/.local/bin`; set `CO_REVIEW_INSTALL_DIR` to
override. Windows users: download the `.zip` from the releases page.

### From source

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/elKei24/herdr-co-review
```

### As a Herdr plugin

```sh
herdr plugin install elKei24/herdr-co-review
herdr plugin link /path/to/checkout    # local dev; skips build steps, so run
                                       # `bash scripts/install-binary.sh` yourself
```

The plugin's install step runs
[`scripts/install-binary.sh`](./scripts/install-binary.sh), which **downloads the
prebuilt binary** for your platform (falling back to `cargo build` only if no
release asset is available) — so installing the plugin needs no Rust toolchain.
You get a "Co-review this pull request" action and a GitHub-PR link handler
(Ctrl+click a PR URL to start a review). Manifest:
[`herdr-plugin.toml`](./herdr-plugin.toml).

Installing the plugin is enough to use the CLI too: it symlinks the binary into
the same directory the installer above would pick, so `co-review start …` works
from your shells. A `co-review` you installed yourself is never overwritten or
shadowed — the step warns and leaves your PATH alone. `CO_REVIEW_NO_PATH_LINK=1`
skips it entirely. The symlink is a convenience for your own shells only: a
running session never resolves `co-review` through PATH — each pane carries the
exact executable in `$CO_REVIEW_BIN`.

`herdr plugin uninstall` removes the plugin but leaves that symlink behind;
`co-review doctor` prints its path so you can `rm` it.

`co-review doctor` reports which `co-review` your PATH resolves to, and flags a
leftover broken link.

## Usage

From inside your repository checkout:

```sh
co-review start 123                     # PR #123 in the current repo's origin
co-review start '#123'
co-review start owner/repo#123
co-review start https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

co-review start 123 --agent codex       # use a different agent
co-review start 123 --prompt "Only look for security issues."
co-review start 123 --dry-run           # offline preview of everything it will do
```

`start` opens the Herdr split-screen. In the navigator:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j`/`k`, `↓`/`↑` | move between findings |
| `g`/`G` | first / last |
| `J`/`K`, `PgDn`/`PgUp` | scroll the detail & code |
| `a` / `d` / `x` / `u` | approve / dismiss / needs-discussion / reset |
| `e` | approve as edited |
| `n` | add / edit your note (shown to the agent) |
| `c` | message the agent about this finding (into its pane) |
| `P` | ask the agent to post the approved findings |
| `r` | force refresh · `?` help · `q` quit |

The mouse works too: click a finding to select it, click a pane to focus it (its
border lights up), and the wheel scrolls the pane under the cursor — the
findings list or the detail & code. Because the navigator captures the mouse,
use `Shift`+drag to select text with your terminal.

Findings appear live as the agent records them; your verdicts and notes are
visible to the agent immediately.

## Managing sessions

Each `start` creates an isolated worktree and a session directory that persist
until you remove them:

```sh
co-review sessions           # list all sessions with their status and counts
co-review view 123           # reopen the navigator for PR #123
co-review end 123            # remove PR #123's worktree and session
co-review end 123 --keep-worktree   # drop the session state but keep the checkout
co-review start 123 --resume        # reopen / refresh an existing session
```

## Configuration

Optional, at `~/.config/co-review/config.toml`. Everything has a default.

```toml
# Which agent to use when --agent is not given.
default_agent = "claude"

# The prompt handed to the agent. `{pr}` and `{protocol}` are substituted.
# Omit to use the built-in prompt (which runs your code-review skill and routes
# findings through co-review). See `co-review prompt`.
# prompt = "..."

# Define or override agents. `{prompt}` in a command is replaced with the review
# prompt; otherwise the prompt is appended as the final argument.
[agents.claude]
kind = "claude"
command = ["claude"]

[agents.my-tool]
command = ["my-tool", "--task", "{prompt}"]
```

Built-in agents: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor`, `amp`, `opencode`.

## The agent contract

The agent records findings and reads your decisions through co-review commands
(`co-review protocol` prints the full reference; the [Claude skill](./skills/co-review/SKILL.md)
teaches Claude to use them). Inside a session the agent never runs a bare
`co-review`: `start` sets `$CO_REVIEW_BIN` in the agent pane to the exact
executable for that session, and the agent invokes everything through it:

```sh
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" add-finding --title "…" --severity high --category correctness \
  --location src/foo.rs:42-48 --body "…" [--suggestion "…"]
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" import findings.json       # bulk add from a JSON array
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" set-status awaiting_review # hand off; the agent then idles until
                                            # the navigator says every finding is
                                            # decided
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" wait                       # fallback: block until triage is done
                                            # (for setups without Herdr)
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" list --json                # read verdicts + your notes
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" edit f3 --body "…"         # revise a finding after you discuss it
"$CO_REVIEW_BIN" mark-posted f3 --url <url> # after posting to GitHub
```

You can also post directly (a fallback for agent-agnostic use), given a GitHub
token in `$GH_TOKEN`/`$GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth login`:

```sh
co-review post            # posts approved/edited findings as inline PR comments
co-review post --dry-run  # show what would be posted
```

Run `co-review doctor` to check your environment (git, herdr, agent, token), and
`co-review completions <bash|zsh|fish|powershell|elvish>` to generate a shell
completion script (e.g. `co-review completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_co-review`), or
`co-review man > co-review.1` for a man page.

## Design

See [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](./docs/DECISIONS.md) for the full rationale — why Rust,
why real Herdr panes, why a single lock-guarded state file, why a CLI contract
instead of hand-written JSON, and more.
